## Kubernetes Questions
### What is Kubernetes?
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

### What are the key components of Kubernetes?
The key components of Kubernetes are:

1. Master Node: Controls the cluster and manages scheduling, scaling, and monitoring.
2. Worker Node: Runs the containers and communicates with the master node.
3. Pod: The smallest unit in Kubernetes that encapsulates one or more containers.
4. Service: Provides network connectivity and load balancing for pods.
5. Deployment: Manages the rollout and scaling of application replicas.
6. ReplicaSet: Ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running at all times.
7. Namespace: Provides an isolated environment for resources within a cluster.

### What is a Pod in Kubernetes?
A Pod is the smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes. It represents one or more closely related containers that share the same IP address, storage, and network namespace. Pods are created and managed by Kubernetes to encapsulate and run containerized applications.

### How does Kubernetes handle container scalability?
Kubernetes handles container scalability through its scaling mechanisms:

Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA): Automatically scales the number of pods based on CPU utilization or other custom metrics.
Vertical Pod Autoscaler (VPA): Adjusts the CPU and memory resources allocated to pods based on resource usage patterns.
Cluster Autoscaler: Dynamically adjusts the size of the cluster by adding or removing worker nodes based on demand.

### What is a Kubernetes Deployment?
A Kubernetes Deployment is a resource object that manages the rollout and scaling of application replicas. It ensures a specified number of pod replicas are running at all times and allows rolling updates for zero-downtime deployments.

### How does Kubernetes handle service discovery and load balancing?
Kubernetes provides service discovery and load balancing through the Service resource. Services abstract the underlying pods and provide a stable network endpoint. Kubernetes automatically load balances traffic across multiple pod replicas behind a service.

### What is a Kubernetes ConfigMap?
A ConfigMap is a Kubernetes object used to store non-confidential configuration data as key-value pairs. It decouples configuration from container images, allowing configuration changes without rebuilding the image.

### How does Kubernetes handle container networking?
Kubernetes provides networking among pods through a virtual network. Each pod gets its own IP address, and pods can communicate with each other across nodes using this IP address. Kubernetes handles routing and load balancing for inter-pod communication.

### What is a Persistent Volume in Kubernetes?
A Persistent Volume (PV) is a cluster-wide storage resource provisioned by an administrator. It is independent of any individual pod and allows data to persist across pod restarts. Persistent Volumes are mounted into pods using Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs).

### How can you perform rolling updates in Kubernetes?
Rolling updates in Kubernetes can be performed by updating the Deployment object. Kubernetes gradually replaces the existing pods with the new ones, ensuring that the application remains available during the update process.

2. Enable and configure network policies to control traffic between pods.
3. Use image scanning tools to identify vulnerabilities in container images.
4. Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit using appropriate mechanisms.
5. Regularly apply security patches and updates to the underlying host operating systems.
6. Monitor and audit cluster activities using centralized logging and security auditing tools.

## Recovering your kubernetes Cluster after Datacentre failure
### To recover the Kubernetes master node in a new data center after a data center failure, the following actions need to be taken:
1. Identify the failure: Confirm that the data center hosting the Kubernetes master node is indeed down and not experiencing a temporary issue.

2. Set up a new data center: Identify and provision a new data center or cloud infrastructure to host the Kubernetes master node. Ensure that it meets the necessary requirements for network connectivity, power, and resource availability.

3. Install Kubernetes on the new master node: Set up a new server or virtual machine in the new data center and install the necessary dependencies for running Kubernetes, such as Docker and the Kubernetes control plane components (kube-apiserver, kube-controller-manager, kube-scheduler, etcd).

4. Join the new master node to the cluster: Configure the new master node to join the existing Kubernetes cluster. This typically involves providing the necessary cluster information (e.g., API server endpoint, cluster certificate) and joining it to the etcd cluster.

5. Restore cluster state: If the failed master node had a backup of the cluster state (etcd data), restore it to the new master node. This ensures that the cluster resumes its previous state and configurations.

6. Verify cluster health: Once the new master node is up and running, verify the health of the Kubernetes cluster by checking the status of nodes, pods, and other essential components. Ensure that all cluster services are running as expected.

7. Update DNS and load balancer configurations: If DNS or load balancer configurations were pointing to the failed master node, update them to reflect the new master node's IP or hostname. This ensures that cluster components and users can access the master node properly.

8. Monitor and recover worker nodes: Monitor the cluster to identify any worker nodes that may have been affected by the data center failure. If necessary, take actions to recover or replace these nodes to restore the desired number of operational worker nodes.

9. Update disaster recovery plans: Document the incident and update disaster recovery plans to ensure readiness for future data center failures. Consider implementing high availability measures, such as multi-master setups, to minimize the impact of similar incidents.
