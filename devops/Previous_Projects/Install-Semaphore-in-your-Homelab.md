## 1. Documentation
[Ansible Semaphore: Administration-guide: Installation](https://docs.ansible-semaphore.com/administration-guide/installation)

## 2. Installation
We are going to install Semaphore on an Ubuntu 2204 LTS Server \
First we need a database we will install MariaDB \
Then we will install Semaphore

### 2.1 Install MariaDB
Run these commands
```
# Update Ubuntu
sudo apt update

# Add MariaDB Repo
curl -LsS https://downloads.mariadb.com/MariaDB/mariadb_repo_setup | sudo bash -s --

# Once the repository is added install server and client packages
sudo apt install mariadb-server mariadb-client


# Secure the MariaDB database
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```
use these settings:
```
Switch to unix_socket authentication [Y/n] n
Change the root password? [Y/n] y
Remove anonymous users? [Y/n] y
Disallow root login remotely? [Y/n] y
Remove test database and access to it? [Y/n] y
Reload privilege tables now? [Y/n] y
```

#### 2.1.1 If you need a Non-Root user
run these commands
```
# Connect to database
sudo mariadb

# Create User 
GRANT ALL ON *.* TO 'admin'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password' WITH GRANT OPTION;

# Save user priviledges
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

# Leave the database
exit
```

# Check Status
sudo systemctl status mariadb
```


### 2.2 Installing Semaphore

#### 2.2.1 Install Prerequisites
Run these commands

#### 2.2.3 After installing Ansible we recommend you read our folowing document now:
[Installing Ansible in a Proxmox VM](http://rino.kozow.com/devops/posts/installing-ansible-in-a-proxmox-vm/)

After Ansible is installed on a control node, it is time to add managed nodes to the Ansible inventory. Letâ€™s now edit the hosts file.
```
#### You will need to do the folowing on your Semaphore server (Allow ansible to connect to your VMs

To Generate a SSHpublic/private keypair
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
# Just respond by pressing the enter Key for all prompts
```
If you have generated an SSH public/private keypair on your control node and have an ssh-agent daemon running, you may install SSH public key on your managed node by using the ssh>
```
ssh-copy-id ansible@[your_vm_ip_address]

#  test SSH connection to your managed host:

ssh ansible@10.154.2.80
```
Repeat this for all VMs you need to connect to
