### 1.1 detailed answers
### What Causes Performance Issues on a Java Server?

**Course:** Java Performance Tuning and Optimization

**Explanation:**

1. **Thread Contention:**
   - **Possible Causes:**
     - Multiple threads attempting to access shared resources simultaneously.
     - Overuse of synchronized methods or blocks leading to thread locks.
     - Inefficient use of thread pools.

   - **How to Address:**
     - Reduce the scope of synchronized blocks.
     - Use concurrent collections from `java.util.concurrent` package.
     - Optimize the use of thread pools with appropriate sizes.

   - **Sample Code:**
     ```java
     // Inefficient synchronization
     public synchronized void addValue(int value) {
         sharedResource += value;
     }

     // Improved synchronization
     private final Object lock = new Object();
     public void addValue(int value) {
         synchronized (lock) {
             sharedResource += value;
         }
     }

     // Using concurrent collections
     ConcurrentHashMap<String, Integer> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
     ```

2. **Inadequate Memory Management:**
   - **Possible Causes:**
     - Memory leaks due to unused objects being retained in memory.
     - Incorrect use of data structures leading to excessive memory usage.
     - Improper sizing of collections.

   - **How to Address:**
     - Use tools like VisualVM or JProfiler to detect memory leaks.
     - Use weak references or remove listeners to prevent memory leaks.
     - Choose the right data structure for the task.
     - Avoid initializing large collections without necessity.

   - **Sample Code:**
     ```java
     // Potential memory leak
     private static List<String> cache = new ArrayList<>();

     // Fix: Remove items not needed
     public void clearCache() {
         cache.clear();
     }

     // Using weak references
     WeakReference<MyObject> weakRef = new WeakReference<>(new MyObject());
     ```

3. **Excessive Garbage Collection:**
   - **Possible Causes:**
     - Inappropriate heap size settings leading to frequent GC cycles.
     - Creation of too many short-lived objects.
     - Inefficient use of object pools.

   - **How to Address:**
     - Tune JVM parameters such as `-Xms` and `-Xmx` for heap size.
     - Reduce the creation of temporary objects by reusing them.
     - Implement object pooling where applicable.

   - **Sample Code:**
     ```java
     // Creating too many short-lived objects
     for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
         String temp = new String("Temp");
     }

     // Reusing objects
     StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
     for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
         sb.setLength(0);
         sb.append("Temp");
     }

     // Tuning JVM parameters (example)
     // -Xms512m -Xmx1024m
     ```

## 2. What is Spring Boot Profiles?

**Course:** Spring Boot Essentials

**Explanation:**

- **Purpose:**
  - Manage multiple configurations for different environments (e.g., development, testing, production).

- **How it Works:**
  - Profiles allow you to define separate sets of properties for each environment.
  - Activate a profile using the `spring.profiles.active` property in application properties or as a command-line argument.
  - Each profile can have its own application properties file (e.g., `application-dev.properties`, `application-prod.properties`).

- **Sample Code:**
  ```java
  // application.properties
  spring.profiles.active=dev

  // application-dev.properties
  server.port=8081

  // application-prod.properties
  server.port=80
  ```

- **Usage:**
  - Enables easy switching between configurations without altering the codebase.
  - Supports environment-specific beans using `@Profile` annotation.
  - Facilitates consistent deployment practices across different environments.


## 2.1 Spring Boot Profiles in more details

**Course:** Spring Boot Essentials

**Explanation:**

- **Purpose:**
  - Manage multiple configurations for different environments (e.g., development, testing, production).

- **How it Works:**
  - Profiles allow you to define separate sets of properties for each environment.
  - Activate a profile using the `spring.profiles.active` property in application properties or as a command-line argument.
  - Each profile can have its own application properties file (e.g., `application-dev.properties`, `application-prod.properties`).

- **Usage:**
  - Enables easy switching between configurations without altering the codebase.
  - Supports environment-specific beans using `@Profile` annotation.
  - Facilitates consistent deployment practices across different environments.

**Sample Code:**

- **Common Configuration:**
  ```properties
  # application.properties
  spring.profiles.active=dev
  ```

- **Development Profile:**
  ```properties
  # application-dev.properties
  server.port=8081
  spring.datasource.url=jdbc:h2:mem:devdb
  spring.datasource.username=devuser
  spring.datasource.password=devpass
  logging.level.org.springframework=DEBUG
  ```

- **Production Profile:**
  ```properties
  # application-prod.properties
  server.port=80
  spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://prod-db-server:3306/proddb
  spring.datasource.username=produser
  spring.datasource.password=prodpass
  logging.level.org.springframework=INFO
  ```

- **Code Example with `@Profile`:**
  ```java
  import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
  import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
  import org.springframework.context.annotation.Profile;

  @Configuration
  public class AppConfig {

      @Bean
      @Profile("dev")
      public DataSource devDataSource() {
          return DataSourceBuilder.create()
                  .url("jdbc:h2:mem:devdb")
                  .username("devuser")
                  .password("devpass")
                  .build();
      }

      @Bean
      @Profile("prod")
      public DataSource prodDataSource() {
          return DataSourceBuilder.create()
                  .url("jdbc:mysql://prod-db-server:3306/proddb")
                  .username("produser")
                  .password("prodpass")
                  .build();
      }
  }
  ```

**Detailed Description:**

- **Profile Activation:**
  - You can activate a profile via the `spring.profiles.active` property in the `application.properties` file or by passing it as a command-line argument (`--spring.profiles.active=prod`).

- **Environment-Specific Properties:**
  - Development properties (`application-dev.properties`) can include settings such as a different server port, in-memory database URL, and debug logging level.
  - Production properties (`application-prod.properties`) might specify a production database URL, secure credentials, and a more restrictive logging level.

- **Profile-Specific Beans:**
  - Use the `@Profile` annotation to create beans that are specific to a particular profile.
  - This allows for the instantiation of different beans depending on the active profile, ensuring environment-specific configurations are applied correctly.

## 3. What are JWT Tokens? Where are they Used?

**Course:** Secure Java Development

**Explanation:**
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** are a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties.
- They are commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications, where they allow secure information exchange between a client and a server.

## 3.1 Detailed Explanation on JWT

**What are JWT Tokens?**
- **Structure:**
  - JWTs consist of three parts: Header, Payload, and Signature.
  - The Header typically consists of two parts: the type of token (JWT) and the signing algorithm (e.g., HMAC SHA256).
  - The Payload contains the claims. Claims are statements about an entity (typically, the user) and additional data.
  - The Signature ensures that the token hasn't been altered. It's created by taking the encoded header, the encoded payload, a secret, and the algorithm specified in the header, and signing them.

**Example Structure:**
```plaintext
Header:    { "alg": "HS256", "typ": "JWT" }
Payload:   { "sub": "1234567890", "name": "John Doe", "iat": 1516239022 }
Signature: HMACSHA256(base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + base64UrlEncode(payload), secret)
```

**Usage:**
- **Authentication:**
  - After a user logs in, a JWT is generated and sent to the client. The client stores the token (usually in local storage or a cookie) and includes it in the Authorization header of subsequent requests.
  - Example: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
- **Authorization:**
  - The server verifies the token's signature and extracts the user information to check the user's permissions for the requested resource.

**Advantages:**
- **Compact:**
  - Due to their small size, JWTs can be easily sent via URL, POST parameters, or inside an HTTP header.
- **Self-contained:**
  - JWTs carry all the necessary information about the user, eliminating the need to query the database multiple times.
- **Secure:**
  - The signature ensures the integrity of the token. If the payload or header is altered, the signature will no longer match.

**Sample Code:**

- **Generating a JWT in Java:**
  ```java
  import io.jsonwebtoken.Jwts;
  import io.jsonwebtoken.SignatureAlgorithm;

  String jwt = Jwts.builder()
      .setSubject("1234567890")
      .claim("name", "John Doe")
      .claim("role", "admin")
      .signWith(SignatureAlgorithm.HS256, "secret")
      .compact();
  ```

- **Validating a JWT in Java:**
  ```java
  import io.jsonwebtoken.Jwts;
  import io.jsonwebtoken.Claims;

  Claims claims = Jwts.parser()
      .setSigningKey("secret")
      .parseClaimsJws(jwt)
      .getBody();

  String subject = claims.getSubject();
  String name = claims.get("name", String.class);
  String role = claims.get("role", String.class);
  ```

**Common Use Cases:**
- **Web Security:**
  - Securing API endpoints in web applications.
- **Single Sign-On (SSO):**
  - JWTs facilitate SSO where a single authentication credential allows access to multiple applications.
- **Microservices:**
  - JWTs are used for secure communication between microservices in a distributed system.


## 4. What is a Comparator and Comparable in Java?

**Course:** Java Collections Framework

**Explanation:**
- **Comparable:** Interface used to define a natural ordering for objects of a class by implementing the `compareTo` method.
- **Comparator:** Interface used to define custom ordering for objects of a class by implementing the `compare` method, allowing different ordering strategies.

Both `Comparator` and `Comparable` are used with Java collections to sort and compare objects.


## 4.1 More details

**Course:** Java Collections Framework

**Explanation:**
- **Comparable:** Interface used to define a natural ordering for objects of a class by implementing the `compareTo` method. It is commonly used with collections like `TreeSet` and `TreeMap` to maintain sorted order.
- **Comparator:** Interface used to define custom ordering for objects of a class by implementing the `compare` method. This allows different ordering strategies and is used by sorting methods in Java collections like `Collections.sort` and `Arrays.sort`.

**Detailed Explanation:**

1. **Comparable:**
   - **Purpose:** Defines the natural ordering of objects.
   - **Method:** `int compareTo(T o)`
   - **Usage:** Used when objects have a single natural sorting order.
   - **Example:**
     ```java
     import java.util.*;

     public class Person implements Comparable<Person> {
         private String name;
         private int age;

         public Person(String name, int age) {
             this.name = name;
             this.age = age;
         }

         @Override
         public int compareTo(Person other) {
             return Integer.compare(this.age, other.age);
         }

         @Override
         public String toString() {
             return name + " (" + age + ")";
         }

         public static void main(String[] args) {
             List<Person> people = new ArrayList<>();
             people.add(new Person("Alice", 30));
             people.add(new Person("Bob", 25));
             people.add(new Person("Charlie", 35));

             Collections.sort(people);

             System.out.println(people);
         }
     }
     ```

2. **Comparator:**
   - **Purpose:** Defines custom ordering of objects.
   - **Method:** `int compare(T o1, T o2)`
   - **Usage:** Used when objects need multiple sorting orders or a custom order.
   - **Example:**
     ```java
     import java.util.*;

     public class Person {
         private String name;
         private int age;

         public Person(String name, int age) {
             this.name = name;
             this.age = age;
         }

         @Override
         public String toString() {
             return name + " (" + age + ")";
         }

         public static void main(String[] args) {
             List<Person> people = new ArrayList<>();
             people.add(new Person("Alice", 30));
             people.add(new Person("Bob", 25));
             people.add(new Person("Charlie", 35));

             // Sort by name using Comparator
             Collections.sort(people, new Comparator<Person>() {
                 @Override
                 public int compare(Person p1, Person p2) {
                     return p1.name.compareTo(p2.name);
                 }
             });

             System.out.println("Sorted by name: " + people);

             // Sort by age using Comparator
             Collections.sort(people, new Comparator<Person>() {
                 @Override
                 public int compare(Person p1, Person p2) {
                     return Integer.compare(p1.age, p2.age);
                 }
             });

             System.out.println("Sorted by age: " + people);
         }
     }
     ```
