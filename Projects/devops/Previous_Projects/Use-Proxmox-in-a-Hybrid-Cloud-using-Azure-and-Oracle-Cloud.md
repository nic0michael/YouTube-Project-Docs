## The demand for Persons with Cloud Skills
There is a great demand for people with Cloud skills this is why we created this video

## Our Goal
We want to have a High Availability Cluster in a Hybrid Cloud spread accross 3 data centers.

## Our Approach
1. We will create VMs in our own Enterprise Proxmox environment 
2. We will create VMs in the Oracle Cloud
3. We will create VMs in the Micosoft Azure Cloud
4. In Order to test our Hybrid cloud We will create a Kubernetes High-Availibility Cluster
5. Each datacenter will have a Kubernetes Master Node 
6. we will create Worker nodes in one data center as it will be easy to spin-up new ones in the other datacenters

## How we created the Oracle Cloud VM
To save time please look at this video : \
**[Setting up the VM in Oracle Cloud (Free for life)](https://youtu.be/1lOzZ9JXBZI)**

## We will demonstrate how we create a VM in the Microsoft Azure Cloud
We will update this while creating the Video

## We will create VMs in our Proxmox server
This will be a short demo

## After creating the VMs we will install Tailscalein in all the VMs
For instrustions please watch this video : \
**[How to install Tailscale in your VMs](https://youtu.be/ofOKZHtu1x0)**

## To Test our Hybrid Cloud we will install K3S Kubernetes
Here we will use a Python Script to generate our shell scripts to create a High-Availability Cluster \
