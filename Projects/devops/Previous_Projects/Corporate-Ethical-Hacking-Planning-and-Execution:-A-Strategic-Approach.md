### 2.2.2.3 Banner Grabbing: 
Banner grabbing is a reconnaissance technique used to extract information from service banners, which are metadata or identification strings sent by network services upon connection establishment. These banners often include details such as service name, version number, and sometimes even operating system information. Banner grabbing can provide valuable insights into the target system's configuration and potentially reveal vulnerabilities that can be exploited.
This command will initiate banner grabbing using Metasploit, where the tool will attempt to extract service banners from open ports on the target system to identify the associated services and versions. Adjust the RHOSTS option to specify the target IP range.

**Here are some examples of what service banners might look like for different types of services:**

HTTP Service:
```
Server: Apache/2.4.29 (Ubuntu)
```

FTP Service:
```
