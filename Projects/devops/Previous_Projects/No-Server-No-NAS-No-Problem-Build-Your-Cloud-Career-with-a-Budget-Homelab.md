In today’s video, I’ll show you how I built a homelab with a secondhand PC under $100. \
It has 64GB of RAM and runs Proxmox for virtualization. \
You don’t need a server or NAS to get started. \
I’ll also share Udemy courses that helped me learn. \ 
And how I use GitHub to build a project portfolio. \
If you’re aiming for a cloud career, this is a great place to start.

## 1. Intro – Why I Built a Homelab

- I’ll show you how I built my homelab using a secondhand PC.
- This setup is focused on hands-on experience, not expensive gear.
- There’s huge demand for Cloud Engineers and DevOps professionals.
- A homelab is one of the best ways to gain real-world experience from home.

- I use a secondhand Dell Optiplex 9020 PC with 64GB of RAM and an Intel i7 CPU.
- Proxmox runs on a dedicated 512 GB SSD drive.
- Two 2TB hard drives provide storage for VMs, containers, and backups.
- I prioritized RAM over buying a full server or NAS—memory is key for running multiple services.

## 3. Why I Use Proxmox
![Proxmox Image](http://rino.kozow.com/devops/images/proxmox.png)

- Proxmox is free, open-source, and perfect for homelabs.
- It supports both virtual machines and LXC containers.
- It has a great web UI and is lightweight on resources.
- It lets me easily manage different environments for testing and learning.

## 4. How This Homelab Helps Me Learn Cloud & DevOps
![Cloud Skills](http://rino.kozow.com/devops/images/Cloudskills.jpg)

- I run Docker containers, Kubernetes clusters, and Linux VMs on this setup.
- It allows me to practice real-world skills like:
  - Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
  - Automation and CI/CD pipelines
  - Linux system administration
  - Networking and storage
- I use it to replicate cloud environments on a local scale.

## 5. Udemy Courses I Recommend

- I’ve used Udemy to build foundational knowledge.
- Some of the most useful courses I took covered:
  - Docker & Containers
  - Kubernetes for Beginners
  - Terraform and Infrastructure as Code
  - Linux Essentials
- I applied what I learned directly in my homelab for hands-on practice.

## 6. My GitHub Portfolio – Showing What I’ve Built

- I upload my homelab projects to GitHub as part of my portfolio.
- These include:
  - Docker Compose setups
  - Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts
  - Automation scripts and CLI tools
- A public GitHub portfolio is great for showing future employers what you can do.

## 7. Final Thoughts – Your Career Starts at Home

- You don’t need a datacenter to start learning cloud tech.
- A budget PC and a bit of RAM is enough to simulate real environments.
- Your homelab can become your playground—and your resume.
- Start small, document your work, and share your journey.
