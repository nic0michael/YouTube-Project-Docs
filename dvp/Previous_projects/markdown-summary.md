Lists

Sometimes you want numbered lists:
```
1. One
2. Two
3. Three
```
Sometimes you want bullet points:
```
* Start a line with a star
* Profit!
```

Headers
```
# This is an 
tag

## This is an 
tag

###### This is an 
```

Emphasis
```
*This text will be italic*
_This will also be italic_

**This text will be bold**
__This will also be bold__

*You **can** combine them*
```

Images
```
![GitHub Logo](/images/logo.png)
Format: ![Alt Text](url)

![This is an image](https://myoctocat.com/assets/images/base-octocat.svg)
```

Links
```
http://github.com - automatic!
[GitHub](http://github.com)
```

Tables
You can create tables by assembling a list of words and dividing them with hyphens - (for the first row), and then separating each column with a pipe |:
```
First Header | Second Header
------------ | -------------
Content from cell 1 | Content from cell 2
Content in the first column | Content in the second column
```

Automatic linking for URLs
```
Any URL (like http://www.github.com/) will be automatically converted into a clickable link.
```
